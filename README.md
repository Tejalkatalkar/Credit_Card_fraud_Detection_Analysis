# Credit_Card_fraud_Detection_Analysis
**Overview**
This Python project focuses on Credit Card Fraud Detection, utilizing a structured dataset containing transaction records along with user and merchant details. The goal is to analyze transaction patterns, detect anomalies, and develop predictive models to identify fraudulent transactions efficiently. Early detection of fraud helps financial institutions mitigate risks and enhance transactional security.

**Project Objectives**
Data Preprocessing: Clean and transform the dataset for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize transaction trends and identify patterns in fraudulent activities.
Model Building: Develop machine learning models to predict fraudulent transactions.
Performance Evaluation: Use metrics such as Precision, Recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.

**Technologies Used**
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

**Key Questions Explored**

Q1.What is the distribution of fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions in the dataset?
Q2.Which merchant categories are most prone to fraudulent transactions based on a bar plot analysis?
Q3.What is the average transaction amount in the dataset?
Q4.What is the average transaction amount for fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions?
Q5.What is the overall average of transaction amounts in the dataset?
Q6.What is the average transaction amount?
Q7.How can I extract the hour from the transaction timestamp?
Q8.How can I calculate fraud rates by category?
Q9.How can I create a KDE plot to show the density of fraudulent transactions?
Q10.How can I calculate the gender-based fraud count?
q11.How can I calculate the average transaction amounts?
